The zip file contains 
1) All the python files used for fine-tuning, evaluation, qualitative analysis, and confusion matrices. 
2) albert.png, bert.png, and Distilbert.png, which are the saved images for the generated confusion matrices. 
3) Hyperparameters.xlsx which is the excel file containing all the hyperparameters used for fine-tuning. 
4) emotion_predictions.xlsx which is the excel file containing all the qualitative analysis for the emotion dataset. 
5) tweet_predictions.xlsx which is the excel file containing all the qualitative analysis for the tweet dataset. 
6) Evaluation_Metrics_Combined which is the combined excel file for the evaluations on both the emotion and tweet datasets. 

How to access the trained models: 
1) The models are pushed onto the hub and example code to use it is provided in the report at the end. 
2) They can be loaded and used directly. 
3) If there is an issue doing the same, the zip file contains folders that have all the files saved. These folders can be saved locally and the model and its tokenizer can be loaded using the path.
